WtF.js Processor (Watch that Folder Processor)
==============================================

# Description

The Watch that Folder Processor monitors files in a directory, processes them 
through some JS code or a XLST transformation and drops a copy of the original
file in the "treated" folder and the resulting processed file in the "processed"
folder. If you don't want to output any file this can be controlled from your
code.
